3,13-Jan-65,F-8C Crusader,147011,VF-24,USN,USS Hancock,Lt(jg) Tom Irwin (Survived)Upon landing back from an air intercept training flight a Crusader suffered a tail hook failure as it snagged the Hancock’s No 4 wire and went over the side.  The aircraft was not flying fast enough for a safe ejection so the pilot stayed with the F-8 as it ditched.  The afterburner cut in just as the aircraft hit the water and the engine exploded.  The canopy was jettisoned and Lt Irwin swam away from the aircraft before it sank.  He was rescued by one of the carrier’s SH-2 Seasprites and was back on the deck of the Hancock within two minutes of ditching.

6,7-Feb-65,A-4E Skyhawk,150075,VA-155,USN,USS Coral Sea,"Lt Edward Andrew Dickson (KIA)Following the establishment of TF 77 aircraft carriers in the South China Sea in August 1964 it was six months before the US Navy was again in action although 13 naval aircraft had been lost in accidents over Southeast Asian waters during this time.  Although air strikes against North Vietnam were part of President Johnson’s 2 December plan they were not immediately instigated.  However, VC attacks on US facilities at Saigon on 24 December and Pleiku and Camp Holloway on 7 February caused President Johnson to order the first air strike against North Vietnam since Pierce Arrow in August 1964.  The new strike, code named Flaming Dart I, was due to be flown by the US Navy from the carriers Coral Sea, Hancock and Ranger.  The targets were at Dong Hoi and Vit Thu Lu while other targets were hit by VNAF A-1s.  The raid was led by Cdr Warren H Sells, Commander of Hancock’s Air Wing 21.  In the event monsoon weather forced the 34 aircraft of USS Ranger’s strike force to abort their mission against Vit Thu Lu but Dong Hoi’s barracks and port facilities were attacked by 20 aircraft from the Coral Sea and 29 from the Hancock.  The strike was carried out at low level under a 700 feet cloud base in rain and poor visibility.  Only one naval aircraft was lost during the strike, a Skyhawk (call sign Silver Fox 503) flown by Lt Dickson of VA-155.  Lt Dickson was a section leader of a flight of four aircraft.  About five miles south of the target he reported that he had been hit by AAA and requested his wingman to check his aircraft over as they commenced their run in to the target.  Just as the flight was about release its bombs Lt Dickson’s aircraft was seen to burst into flames, but despite a warning from his wingman, he continued with his bomb run and released his Snakeye bombs on target.  Lt Dickson headed out towards the sea but his aircraft became engulfed in flames and he ejected.  Although he was seen to eject his parachute was not seen to deploy and the aircraft crashed into the sea about half a mile offshore.  There was no sign of Lt Dickson in the water despite a SAR effort that continued for two days.  However, in March 1968 a Vietnamese newspaper printed a photograph of a grave on a beach which was claimed to be that of Lt Dickson and in August 1985 the Vietnamese handed over the Lieutenant’s Geneva Convention and ID Card which would seem to confirm the beach burial.Edward Dickson had had a miraculous escape from death just one year earlier when he was forced to eject from his Skyhawk over the Sierra Nevada mountains in California during a training exercise.  His parachute failed to deploy properly but he landed in a deep snowdrift that broke his fall causing only minor injuries.  However, on 7 February 1965 his luck ran out and he became the second US aviator to die while attacking North Vietnam.  Edward Dickson was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his determination to complete the mission despite crippling combat damage."
7,10-Feb-65,A-1E Skyraider,52-132401,"1 ACS, 34 TG",USAF,Bien Hoa,Capt William Young Duggan (Survived)1 VNAF observer name unknown (KIA)During a close air support mission an A-1 was hit by ground fire and the starboard wing burst into flames.  The aircraft crashed into the sea just off the Mekong Delta and only the USAF pilot survived to be rescued by helicopter.  Capt Duggan later returned to Southeast Asia as a Phantom pilot and was killed during a mission over southern Laos on New Year’s Eve 1971.

Maj Ronca had flown C-47 and C-46 transport aircraft during World War 2 and then flew the F-86 Sabre in the Korean War and was credited with shooting down a MiG-15."

11,24-Feb-65,A-3B Skywarrior,147664,VAH-2,USN,USS Coral Sea,"BMC Dwight Glenn Frakes (KWF)3 crew names unknown (Survived)During a tanker sortie, a Skywarrior suffered a fuel transfer problem and the crew of four were forced to abandon the aircraft eight miles from the Coral Sea.  Only three of the crew were found and rescued by helicopters from the Coral Sea and the Yorktown.  It was thought that BMC Frakes had either been unable to inflate his life vest for some reason or had become tangled in his parachute’s shroud lines and drowned.  The aircraft was the fifth to last Skywarrior built and had been delivered to the Navy in November 1960."

Although restrictions remained on the employment of US aircraft when VNAF air power was available, the necessity to carry VNAF ‘observers’ was relaxed and the USAF and Army aircraft based in South Vietnam could now fly in US markings rather than VNAF markings."
17,11-Mar-65,B-57B Canberra,53-3890,"8 TBS, 405 FW attached to 34 TG",USAF,Bien Hoa,"Capt William Carroll Mattis (KIA)1Lt Richard Dean Smith (KIA)The B-57 squadrons at Bien Hoa had seen little action since their arrival in South Vietnam in August 1964.  However, on 18 February restrictions on their use in the offensive role were lifted and the Canberras began air strikes in South Vietnam and took part in some of the early Rolling Thunder operations in North Vietnam.  On 11 March two Canberras were attacking a target about 30 miles northeast of Kontum when one of the aircraft suddenly burst into flames and crashed.  It was thought that the aircraft had probably been destroyed by the explosions from its own 500lb bombs as the B-57 had dropped them from a very low altitude.  The body of Capt Mattis was recovered soon after the incident but it was not until 1994 that the remains of Richard Smith, since promoted to Lt Col in absentia, were recovered and identified during a JTF-FA investigation."
18,15-Mar-65,A-1H Skyraider,135375,VA-95,USN,USS Ranger,Lt(jg) Charles Frederick Clydesdale (KIA)The US Navy was to play a major part in the Rolling Thunder campaign and flew most its strikes against targets to the east of Hanoi or close to the coast.  The first Rolling Thunder strike flown by the Navy was against an ammunition dump at Phu Qui.  Lt Clydesdale was killed when he ditched the Skyraider (call sign Fortress 512) in the sea after the engine lost power while returning to his carrier.
19,21-Mar-65,A-1E Skyraider,52-132649,"1 ACS, 34 TG",USAF,Bien Hoa,"Capt William Henry Campbell (KIA)Capt Jerry Pavey Hawkins (KIA)During an interdiction sortie near Can Tho a Skyraider was seen to catch fire and turned over when crash-landing.  Although both pilots were found to be dead the aircraft itself was deemed salvageable so an Army CH-54 Skycrane helicopter airlifted it to Tan Son Nhut.  The Skyraider was indeed repaired and re-assigned to the 1st ACS.  On 10 March 1966 this Skyraider was flown by Maj Bernard Fisher when he performed a daring rescue of a fellow pilot at the A Shau Special Forces Camp, a feat for which Maj Fisher was awarded the Medal of Honour.  The aircraft is now on display in the National Museum of the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB."
20,22-Mar-65,F-105D Thunderchief,62-4233,"67 TFS, 18 TFW attached to 6234 TFW",USAF,Korat,"Lt Col James Robinson Risner (Survived)Lt Col Robinson Risner became a well known POW when he was shot down on 16 September 1965 but that was the second time that the CO of the 67th TFS had parted company with a Thunderchief during a raid on North Vietnam.  The first occasion occurred during an early Rolling Thunder mission on 22 March against the Vinh Son radar site when his aircraft was hit by ground fire as he was attacking an AAA site.  He managed to fly his aircraft out over the sea where he ejected about a mile offshore and was picked up by a USAF HU-16B Albatross.  Risner appeared on the front cover of Time magazine after this incident, a fact that did not serve him well when he became a POW later in the year."
